3. About myself:
   > For the last 3 years I have been working as a programmer, but, unfortunately, I have no right to talk about my projects, and even the languages in which they are written. I can only say that this is a very narrow specialization.
Unfortunately, the demand for specialists in my field is extremely low, so I have to learn something new. Besides, in my opinion, there are a lot of things that are more interesting than my current job and front-end development is one of them.
4. I have some knowledge and experience in:
    1. Programming languges:
       1. C/C++, Qt;
       2. Java (JavaFX);
    2. IDEs:
       1. NetBeans;
       2. Qt Creator;
       3. Code - OSS (VSCode);
    3. Misc:
       1. Robot Operating System
       2. Various electronics development software: MPLAB IDE, OrCAD, Xilinx ISE Design Suite, Arduino IDE, Diptrace...
5. Code examples. <br>
   Unfortunately, I don't have open source projects yet that I can show in this section. Therefore, for now, only a small insert:
