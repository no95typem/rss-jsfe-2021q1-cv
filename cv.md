3. About myself:
   > For the last 3 years I have been working as a programmer, but, unfortunately, I have no right to talk about my projects, and even the languages in which they are written. I can only say that this is a very narrow specialization.
Unfortunately, the demand for specialists in my field is extremely low, so I have to learn something new. Besides, in my opinion, there are a lot of things that are more interesting than my current job and front-end development is one of them.
